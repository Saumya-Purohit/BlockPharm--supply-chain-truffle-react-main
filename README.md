BLOCKPHARM

Employing blockchain technology, I led the development of an innovative pharmaceutical supply chain portal. This initiative brought about remarkable results, including achieving complete traceability and transparency across the supply chain, significantly enhancing coordination among stakeholders, and providing real-time visibility into operations. The technology stack for this achievement encompassed essential tools like Ganache, Truffle, Solidity, React, and Metamask, which were instrumental in creating a robust and efficient solution.
